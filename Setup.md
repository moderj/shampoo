[[_TOC_]]

## 1. Set up WSL

Wsl (Windows Subsystem Linux) is a Linux environment that runs on Windows. You
can read more about it
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

### 1.1. Install WSL

Open PowerShell (or Windows Command Prompt) as an admin:

1. Right click on PowerShell
2. Click "Run as administrator" and enter:

```PowerShell
wsl --install
```

Check the
[troubleshooting installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)
article if you run into any issues.

### 1.2. Set up your Linux username and password

Once the process of installing your Linux distribution with WSL is complete,
open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) using the Start menu. You will be
asked to create a User Name and Password for your Linux distribution. This
account will be considered the Linux administrator, with the ability to run sudo
(Super User Do) administrative commands.

For more information, see
[this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password).

### 1.3. Set up Windows Terminal (Recommended)

Windows Terminal can run any application with a command line interface.

Also, it comes with
[Quake mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1-9-release/#quake-mode)
which allows you to quickly open a new terminal instance from anywhere in
Windows by typing `` Win+` ``. It is a great way to run commands on your Linux
distribution.

Windows Terminal is built in Windows 11.
To install you can follow the
[installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install#invoke-the-command-palette).

#### **Set your default profile**

On windows terminal, enter `ctrl + ,` to open setting.

Select Startup and choose `Ubuntu` as your default profile.

To move between tab terminals, use `ctrl+tab` and `ctrl+shift+tab`. To close a
tab in terminal, enter `ctrl+shift+w`. To open a new tab, enter `ctrl+shift+T`.

### 1.4. Update and upgrade packages

It is recommended to update and upgrade your packages before you start using
your Linux distribution.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### 1.5. Install zsh

Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful
scripting language.

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Configure zsh to be the default shell:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

You can check your shell by running `echo $SHELL`.

### 1.6. Install zap (Recommended)

[Zap](https://www.zapzsh.com/) is a minimal zsh plugin manager.

```bash
zsh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zap-zsh/zap/master/install.zsh) --branch release-v1
```

## 2. Install VS code

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a source-code editor made by Microsoft including
support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion,
snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

In order to use VS code in your [WSL](#1-set-up-wsl) First install VS
code in Windows and then the Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL Extension.

### 2.1 Install VS code on Windows

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on the Windows side (not in
WSL).

### 2.2 Install VS code on WSL

Install the
[Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
pack.

Now we can open Workspace from the terminal using the `code` command:

```bash
code path/to/workspace
```

Or navigate to workspace first and then use `code`:

```bash
cd path/to/workspace
code .
```

For more information, About working with VS code on WSL see
[Developing in WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

## 3. Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop for Windows provides a development environment for building,
shipping, and running dockerize apps. By enabling the WSL 2 based engine, you
can run both Linux and Windows containers in Docker Desktop on the same machine.

_Note: While Docker Desktop supports running both Linux and Windows containers,
you can not run both simultaneously. To run Linux and Windows containers
simultaneously, you would need to install and run a separate Docker instance in
WSL._

### 3.1 Sign up for a Docker ID at Docker Hub (optional)

Docker Hub is a service for finding and sharing container images with the Docker
community.

[SignUp link](https://hub.docker.com/signup/)

### 3.2 Install Docker Desktop on Windows

1. Download
   [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#download)
   and follow the installation instructions.

2. Ensure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is checked in **Settings >
   General**.

   ![Use the WSL 2 based engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/docker-running.png)

3. Select from your installed WSL 2 distributions which you want to enable
   Docker integration on by going to: **Settings > Resources > WSL
   Integration**.

4. Select from your installed WSL 2 distributions which you want to enable
   Docker integration on by going to: _Settings > Resources > WSL Integration_.

5. To confirm that Docker has been installed, open a WSL distribution and
   display the version and build number by entering: `docker --version`, and
   `docker run hello-world`.
