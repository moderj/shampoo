## Get Started with typescript

You can start "playing" with typescript online in [sandbox](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

In order to run it locally we need to install typescript and then compile our code into executable javascript.

### Install

TypeScript is available as a [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) on the npm registry.

You can install it as dev-dependency in your project using:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

if you want typescript support in `node:` imports and global node variables you need to install [`@types/node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node)

```bash
npm install @types/node --save-dev
```

_Side Note: Sometimes You will need types in the [declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html). If so install the types as `dependencies`. You can read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45176661/how-do-i-decide-whether-types-goes-into-dependencies-or-devdependencies) for more information._

### TSConfig

Typescript compiler needs instructions to compile. We can specify the compiler options in config file called [`tsconfig`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

You can initialize the compiler options using `tsc` cli `--init` flag:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

This will create a basic `tsconfig.json` file.

My recommended `tsconfig.json` for modern node applications is:

`compilerOptions`:

- `"module": "NodeNext"` - Tells TS that this project use ES Modules (And the module resolution is NodeNext)

- `target": "ESNext"` - Tells TS that it's okay to output JavaScript syntax with new features instead of embedding a polyfill.

- `"strict": true` - Tells TS to enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness.

- `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true` - Tells TS to add `undefined` to any declared via index signatures field in the type.

- `skipLibCheck": true` - Tells TS to skip type checking of all declaration files (\*.d.ts). This can save time during compilation and solve incompatibly issues between libraries.

Here is a recommended `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
}
```
You can run this script in your terminal to create the file:

```bash
curl https://gitlab.com/davidbk6/shampoo/-/raw/14055316e7a305253eef65ed430a169e1141d70a/tsconfig.json -o tsconfig.json
```

Here is the full [TSConfig Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)

### Basic Compile

You can use the `tsc` cli using `npx`:

```bash
npx tsc
```

Or you can create a npm script:

In your `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  },
```

And then:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test it! create `.ts` file and run the compile `.js`.

### TypeScript Execute - tsx (Optional)

tsx (TypeScript eXecute - do not confuse with React's [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) files which stand for TypeScript XML) is a TypeScript runtime that allows you to execute TypeScript files directly. 

This tool is useful for running TypeScript files without the need to compile them to JavaScript first.

You can use it without any setup using `npx`:

```bash
npx tsx <your-file>.ts
```

You can read more in the [tsx repo](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx).

### ts-node (Optional)

[`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js. It "Just In Time" (JIT) transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling.

Install it as a devDependency:

```bash
npm i -D ts-node
```

And then run your file:

```bash
npx node-ts <your-file>.ts
```

You can add it to your npm scripts:

```json
"dev": "ts-node <your-file>.ts"
```

If you like to use [esm](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) (and you should) you can use it as a [loader](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#loaders) to your file:

```json
"dev": "node --loader ts-node/esm <your-file>.ts"
```

If you use ts-node I recommend to add the configuration to the tsconfig file as `"ts-node"`.

```json
 "ts-node": {
   "swc": true,
 }
```

You can read more in the [ts-node docs](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/).

### Other JS runtime (Advanced)

Some modern JavaScript engines runtime come with built-in support for TypeScript:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses [V8](https://v8.dev) and is built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Deno has "First-class" support for TS and its "Understand" (Using JIT) Typescript so you execute your `.ts` using `deno`.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno. Bun uses the [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) engine and was written in [ZIG](https://ziglang.org). Bun is designed as a drop-in replacement for your current JavaScript & TypeScript apps or scripts so you can run `.ts` files directly.

## TypeScript - The basics

You should be familiar with the following concepts:

You can read them all in the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html). Especially the [everyday-types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)

- `string`, `number`, and `boolean`
- Array
- Tuple
- Functions
- Object types
- Type Aliases (`type`)
- Interfaces
- `any` and `unknown`
- Union Types (`|`)
- Intersection Types (`&`)
- Function type expression
- Parameter Destructuring in functions
- Passing Type Arguments (`<Type>`)
- Type Assertions (`as`, `!`)
- `typeof` type operator
- `keyof` type operator
- `null`, `undefined`, `void`, and `never`
- Narrowing and Type guards
- Global utility Types (e.g `Omit`, `Record`, `Promise`, etc.)

### Beginners Typescript Workshops

[Here](https://github.com/total-typescript/beginners-typescript-tutorial) is a great tutorial for all the basics. Do it yourself :smile:

### Questions - Basic Typescript

1. Take the following code and paste it in new `test.js`

   ```js
   const echo = (arg) => arg;

   const greet = echo("Hello From World");
   const veryGreet = greet.map((ch) => ch + "!");
   console.log(veryGreet);
   ```

   Run it using `node test.js` and see the error.

   - What is the problem?
   - How typescript can help me?
   - Create `test.ts` file and fix the code so it will **not** compile.

1. What is the problem? Fix it.

   ```ts
   const productPrices = {
     apple: 1.2,
     banana: 0.5,
     orange: 0.8,
   };

   const getPrice = (productName: string) => productPrices[productName];
   ```

   If you can't see the problem paste the code to [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and see the error.

### Working With TS - My Recommendations

- Write a little TS as you can! TS is very "smart" and most of the time inferred types will be more "specific". Also this will help your code readability.
  - Don't declare types in variables
  - Prefer to not declare return types of _simple_ functions
- Don't use enums, prefer union types or `as const` objects.
- Don't use `Function`, `Object`, `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (Capital letters) and `object` - they are not doing what you think they are doing.
- Be careful with `.json()` (in `fetch` response) and `JSON.parse()` as they both return `any`. You can cast them to `unknown` (or use [ts-reset](https://github.com/total-typescript/ts-reset) to do it for you)
- I Prefer `type` aliases over interfaces for "everyday" types. If you using Object Oriented Programming you can use interfaces but keep in mind the merge behavior of interfaces.

## Runtime checks with TypeScript

TypeScript is lived in "compile-time", which make its great for checking variables at the type level (developer "linting").
However, during "runtime", JavaScript is the only language that is executed.
Therefore, it is necessary to validate user input against schema validation in JavaScript.

In many cases there is a strong corelation between types and runtime schemas, and duplicating type declarations in both schema and types can be cumbersome.

### Zod

[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

The goal is to eliminate duplicate type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator once and Zod will automatically infer the static TypeScript type.
It also allows for easy composition of simpler types into complex data structures.

If you wish to use Zod with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) app, you can use [fastify-type-provider-zod](https://github.com/turkerdev/fastify-type-provider-zod) library.

#### Zod tutorial (optional)

You can do [this](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/zod) tutorial which is a set of zod exercises for you to work through.

### TypeBox (optional)

[TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) is a JSON Schema Type Builder with Static Type Resolution for TypeScript.

With typebox you define your schema within your code and use them directly as types or schemas as you need them (like zod).

TypeBox is great for working with [Fastify in TS](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/TypeScript) because the validation in Fastify uses JSON Schema. Moreover, defining schemas for your Fastify can increase their throughput. To use it in your Fastify you will need [fastify type-provider](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-type-provider-typebox).

For more information you can read in the [Fastify typebox doc](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/TypeScript/#typebox).

## TypeScript - More Topics (optional)

- Generics
- Literal Types and `as const`
- Indexed Access Types (such as `T["key"]`, `T[string]` etc.)
- Index Signatures (such as `[index: string]: number`)
- `extends` keyword

### Questions - More Topics

1. Fix the code so it will Error only in `errVeryStr`

   ```ts
   const echo = (arg) => arg;

   const greet = echo("Hello From Space");
   const greetArr = echo(greet.split(""));

   // @ts-expect-error
   const errVeryGreet = greet.map((ch) => ch + "!");
   const veryGreet = greetArr.map((ch) => ch + "!").join("");

   console.log(veryGreet);
   ```

1. Fix the code so `addFullName` function will get any object that satisfies `UserShape`:

   ```ts
   type UserShape = {
     firstName: string;
     lastName: string;
   };

   const addFullName = (user: UserShape) => {
     return {
       ...user,
       fullName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`,
     };
   };

   const actorUser = {
     firstName: "John",
     lastName: "Malkovich",
     hobbies: ["acting", "directing"],
   };

   const soldierUser = {
     firstName: "John",
     lastName: "Rambo",
     rank: "Sergeant",
   };

   const notUser = {
     first_name: "I am not a user",
     lastName: "I told you I am not a user",
   };

   const actor = addFullName(actorUser);
   const soldier = addFullName(soldierUser);
   // @ts-expect-error
   const doNot = addFullName(notUser);

   console.log(actor.hobbies); // Fix the ts error
   console.log(soldier.rank); // Fix the ts error

   // @ts-expect-error
   console.log(actor.rank);
   ```

1. What is the problem with this code? Can you fix it?

   ```ts
   const satellitesCompanies = {
     skysat: "Planet",
     worldview: "Maxar",
     sentinel: "Sentinel",
   };

   type SatellitesCompanies = typeof satellitesCompanies;

   type SkysatCompany = SatellitesCompanies["skysat"];
   type WorldviewCompany = SatellitesCompanies["worldview"];
   type SentinelCompany = SatellitesCompanies["sentinel"];

   declare function freeOrder(company: SentinelCompany): void;
   declare function payedOrder(company: SkysatCompany | WorldviewCompany): void;

   freeOrder("Sentinel");

   // @ts-expect-error
   freeOrder("Planet");

   // @ts-expect-error
   payedOrder("Sentinel");
   ```

1. Change the `SatelliteName` type so it will error on the last line:

   ```ts
   const satellitesNames = [
     "skysat",
     "skywalker",
     "skyscraper",
     "skyrim",
     "skype",
   ];

   type SatelliteName = string;

   declare function isSatelliteGood(satName: SatelliteName): boolean;

   console.log(isSatelliteGood("skywalker"));

   // @ts-expect-error
   console.log(isSatelliteGood("skySat"));
   ```

1. Change the `SatellitesCompaniesNames` type so it will error on the last line:

   ```ts
   const satellitesCompanies = {
     skysat: "Planet",
     worldview: "Maxar",
     sentinel: "Sentinel",
   };

   type SatellitesCompaniesNames = string;

   declare function isCompanyGood(company: SatellitesCompaniesNames): boolean;

   console.log(isCompanyGood("Planet"));

   // @ts-expect-error
   console.log(isCompanyGood("planet"));
   ```

### Questions - Advanced

1. Fix this code so it will error

   ```ts
   type Route = { path: string; children?: Routes };
   type Routes = Record<string, Route>;

   const routes: Routes = {
     AUTH: {
       path: "/auth",
       children: {
         LOGIN: {
           path: "/login",
         },
       },
     },
     HOME: {
       path: "/",
     },
     // @ts-expect-error
     mistake: true,
   };

   // @ts-expect-error
   const { path } = routes.NotExist;
   ```
1. Create `FirstParam` utility type which return the type of the first parameter of function:

    
    ```ts
    const fn = (a: number, b: string) => a;
    type x = FirstParam<typeof fn> // number
    ```

    Do not use explicit `any`!
 
1. - Create a type "function" which generate tuple types. For Example:

     ```ts
     type TupleStr = Tuple<string, 3>;
     // TupleStr = [string, string, string]

     type Tuple2 = Tuple<number, 2>;
     // Tuple2 = [number, number]
     ```

   - Fix the type of this group function:

     ```ts
     /**
      * Groups elements of an array into subarrays of a specified size.
      * If the array length is not a multiple of size, the array is truncated to fit.
      */
     const group = <T>(arr: T[], size = 2) =>
       Array.from({ length: arr.length / size }, (_, i) =>
         arr.slice(i * size, i * size + size)
       );

     const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
     const res = group(arr); // Fix it to be [number, number][]
     const res2 = group(arr, 3); // Fix it to be [number, number, number][]
     ```

   - Fix the Tuple implementation so it will work with distribute over union types:

     ```ts
     const num = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 2 : 3;
     const res3 = group(arr, num); // const res3: ([number, number] | [number, number, number])[]
     ```

1. Fix the types of this `curry` helper function:

   ```ts
   type Fn = (...args: any[]) => any;

   const curry = (fn: Fn) => {
     const curried = (...args: unknown[]) =>
       args.length >= fn.length
         ? fn(...args)
         : (...args2: unknown[]) => curried(...args.concat(args2));

     return curried;
   };

   const sum = curry((a: number, b: number) => a + b);

   const add2 = sum(2); // any. Fix it!

   const test = curry((a: string, b: number, c: boolean) => true); // (...args: unknown[]) => any. Fix it!

   const trueFn = curry(() => true); // Fix it!
   ```
